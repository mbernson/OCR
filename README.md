# OCR

A drag and drop OCR app for Mac that makes it easy to get text out of images.

I wanted a quick way to get text out of images using [Apple's powerful Vision API's](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/vision/recognizing_text_in_images). 
That's why I created this app. It's in an almost-finished state. You can drop an image onto its window and it will write a text file with the same name to your downloads folder, containing the text.

I would like to add a 'results' view, and support for OCR'ing PDF's with multiple pages.

The deployment target is set to macOS Catalina (10.15) because that is what runs on my dad's Mac, who wanted to use this program.
